# Babybel - the baby version of Babel

**This project will not be maintained**.

[There have been major changes in `babel` 6.0](http://babeljs.io/blog/2015/10/29/6.0.0/).

Gone are the days where you can simply `npm install -g babel`
and `babel-node` on a file to check out destructuring
assignment, async/await, and other ECMAScript2015+ goodies.

While we all learn how to use the new babel, this package
will allow us to use it the old way without clobbering the
`babel` package itself. `npm install -g babel@5` is not
needed.

With `babybel`, you can use the old CLI commands (as
`babybel` instead of `babel`, / `babybel-node`, etc.) but
still have the opportunity to use all the cool new
babel stuff.
